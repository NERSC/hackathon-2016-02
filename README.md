Working Document for BES/ASCR Network Performance Hackathon 

LBNL, Feb 23-26 2016

Wang Hall / CRT Building 59 Room 3034

[[TOC]]

# Overview

A group of BES facilities directors has recently convened hackathons involving BES/ASCR staff regarding BES user facility data analysis. This document is the working area for the second hackathon on the topic of network performance. 

Given the relatively small cross section of interest on this topic currently, we have chosen to convene a small group of networking, data transfer node, and IT facility staff around the topic of network performance. The charge from the facility directors was for concrete outcomes, which we have chosen to address by building a simply map of network performance in and between BES facilities. 

# Venue

For attendees coming to LBNL we will meet at LBNL at the new location of NERSC and ESnet, CRT/Wang Hall Room 3116. For attendees attending remotely please direct your browser here:

Day 1: PerfSonar installfest, Globus, DTNs, and DMZs

Day 2: Dashboard design and development.

Day 3: Further development and/or data transfer tuning based on above.

# Proposed Outcome Sketch:

From: LBNL and SLAC

To: BES Facilities Directors

Date: End of February 2016 

We recently held our second BES / ASCR hackathon Feb 23-26 at LBNL. The topic was "network performance" which drew interested attendees from APS, LCLS, ALS, NSLS-II, ESnet, and NERSC facility staff. Recognizing the increasing role of networks in marshalling BES data analysis workflows, we chose to answer your charge with a simple map of the BES user-facility ecosystem. We hope it is useful in furthering a complex-wide understanding of emerging data analysis methodologies. It may also be useful at the upcoming RDA meeting in Tokyo where an international discussion of neutron and lightsource data analysis is planned. 

It is not production software. One of the advantages BES enjoys in developing software frameworks in the current era should be choosing software development best practices that will lead to world-class software capabilities. Hackathons are just a start, and fall under the category of "what you can do for little to no cost." The staff attending voted X to Y that it was useful event in furthering their understanding of network performance. 

URL to map

We hope it is useful. We feel it provides a basic map of the major areas of data production and network flows at these user facilities. A detailed set of hackathon notes are attached. In addition to the deliverable above the following executive summary describes the hackathon outcomes. 

Sincerely, 

Undersigned

Subject: Follow up to your report
 
Dear BES Facilities Computing Working Group,
 
We would like to thank you very much for your considered and detailed response to our recent charge. We found your report both  thought provoking and extremely useful, and there is much to think about and digest. While that happens, however we would to take up two of your suggestions immediately.
 
First, the idea of hack-a-thons on problems of mutual interest strikes us as an extremely productive way to push inter-facility collaboration forward. We would therefore like to ask you to organize three such meetings. Expecting each to be roughly a week or so in length we suggest the following locations and themes:
1.      BNL: Live pipelining/livestreaming data analysis. To be held this fall
2.      SLAC/LBNL: Multi-modal data analysis. To be held early in CY16
3.      ANL: Network performance â€“ including into and out of ESnet. To be held in spring 2016
 
We ask you, for each of these, to
1)      Refine the theme in ways that make sense and define deliverables for the hack-a-thon
2)      Develop longer term goals for each area with a roadmap and timeline
3)      Determine a point of contact from the host institution to direct the efforts.
 
Please communicate these to us for the first event, together with dates for that event, by September 25th.
 
Our expectation is that these events would involve the coders themselves (that is not necessarily the BESFCWG directly) and mark a kick-off of a more extended effort in each case once the coders return to their home institutions. Code should be written following agreed upon standards and useful to all facilities involved. Support for travel expenses will be provided by the home institutions of the coders (not the host institution of the hack-a-thon).
 
After the first one is held, we would appreciate feedback on the format and approach to incorporate into the following events.
 
In addition to the hack-a-thons we would like to follow up on your suggestion of a white paper entitled "Combined BES Data and Analysis Roadmap." We think that this is an excellent idea and written jointly by yourselves would be a very useful document in both laying out the path forward in these areas and in ensuring the facilities work together in a mutually beneficial way. In this regard, we are aware that there is a joint ASCR-BES requirements workshop in early November. We ask that those of you at that workshop reflect the thinking behind your report to our first charge at that workshop, and similarly fold the discussions at that workshop into the roadmap white paper. Bringing ASCR into our thinking and vice versa could be a powerful way to generate the new funding required to support this enterprise long term. We ask that the roadmap white paper be delivered to us by January 1st 2016.
 
Thank you again for your efforts, we recognize that this is an extremely important topic for the future success of our facilities and now is a critical time to act. We very much appreciate your work in this area.
